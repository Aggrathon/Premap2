# PREMAP: Preimage Approximation for Neural Networks

PREMAP is an algorithm for finding both over- and under-approximations for preimages of neural networks.
The preimage is the set of inputs that lead to a specified set of outputs.
Hence, preimage underapproximation can be used for, e.g., quantitative certification of neural networks.
See below for an example or the paper for more information:
